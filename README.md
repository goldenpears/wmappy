Do you ever wonder how list of all countries and cities looks like? Or maybe you wish wikipedia was only for such purpose?  
I have something for you, weirdo

## how to start?
- `git clone https://github.com/goldenpears/wmappy.git`
- import `wmappy/wmappy` folder via Android Studio (yes, second one)
- run on the emulator or your device in the debug mode

## this is how we do it

- [x] Download a list of countries and cities from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/David-Haim/CountriesToCitiesJSON/master/countriesToCities.json
- [ ] Parse that list into a local database.
- [ ] Create a country selector (dropdown or picker) which is populated from the local database.
- [ ] Show a list of cities of the selected country.
- [ ] Upon selecting a city from the list, fetch info about it and display it on a separate screen. For fetching city info use Wikipedia search service http://www.geonames.org/export/wikipedia-webservice.html#wikipediaSearch

## any third-party libraries and frameworks?
not yet!

## screenshots?
